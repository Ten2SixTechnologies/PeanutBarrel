		<u>Illness and Communicable Diseases</u><br/>
		<p>Childhood diseases and illness are part of growing up. Children with fever of 100 degree or higher, or who are otherwise ill, need to have other 
		arrangements made for their care. I would not want your child or someone else to be contagious. If your child becomes ill while in my care they
		will need to be picked up as quickly as possible. After having a contagious disease a signed statement from a doctor will need to be on file stating your child is no
		longer contagious, before they can return to care.</p>
