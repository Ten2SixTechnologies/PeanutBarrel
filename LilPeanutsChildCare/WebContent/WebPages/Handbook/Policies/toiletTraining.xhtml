		<u>Toilet Training</u><br/><br/><br/>
		Toilet training should begin at home over a long weekend, or holiday. Once you have had success at home for at least
		a week, your child may begin wearing CLOTH training pants with rubber pants to cover them at child care. Some pull-ups
		for nap time or other extended periods must still be provided. Also, you MUST provide at least 2 complete changes of clothing
		for your child. Under no circumstances will your child be allowed to potty-train in regular underware. This is for sanitary
		reasons! Regular underware cannot contain urine and feces to prevent the spread of germs to other children in care, or to my
		family. Also, if you begin training, please notify me so that I can continue the work you have accomplished. Further, if
		within 2-3 weeks, your child shows no sign of progress, I reserve the right to put them back in diapers or pull-ups and try
		again in a few weeks.
