		<u>Learning Opportunities</u><br/><br/><br/>
		
		The children's learning time is modeled after the Creative Curriculum Standards.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<u>Infants and todlers:</u>
		<ul>
			<li>Instruction is gained through play. I offer many differant activities and toys from which to choose.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<u>Older toddlers and pre-school:</u>
		<ul>
			<li>Instruciton is gained through play. Their play is their work.</li>
			<li>Play materials that are more focused on interaction for specific development areas.</li>
			<li>Through our interaction and play, I will direct them toward patterns, sorting, adding, subtracting, writing, 
				reading, logical thinking, problem solving, physical, social and emotional development.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		I will be using <a href= "http://teachingstrategies.com/content/pageDocs/GOLD-Touring-Guide_5-2013.pdf" target="_blank">Teaching Strategies Gold</a> 
		to assess your child's progress and development in all areas. You will have 
		two opportunities one in fall and one in spring to attend a Parent Teacher Conference. We will use this time to discuss 
		your child's progress and development, and also discuss future goals.
