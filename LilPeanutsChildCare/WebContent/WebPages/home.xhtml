			Hi, I'm Laura Hayes. I am the owner and operator of Lil' Peanuts Child Care, an in-home licensed child care residence. It is my personal philosophy that every child should be cherished and trained with much love, compassion and understanding. 
			Children learn by example, consistency and positive reinforcement. I look forward to pampering your Lil' Peanut very soon!
